<H1>Zuul Game Pro</H1>
This project is based on the World of Zuul framework from the book Objects First with Java. <br><br>
The original framework provided a simple text-based adventure game with a few rooms <br>
and the ability for the player to walk between them.
<br><br>
As part of my Advanced Programming course final project(Spring 2022), I extended and<br>
customized the game to create Zuul Game Pro.<br><br>


<H2>Compared to the original version, Zuul Game Pro includes:</H2>

ðŸ”¹ More rooms and a larger world to explore

ðŸ”¹ Additional commands (back, list, look, drop, take)

ðŸ”¹ Interactive objects and items in rooms

ðŸ”¹ Improved command parser

ðŸ”¹ Basic game progression elements
<br><br>
<H2>How to Run</H2>

**1-** Open the project in **BlueJ** or any **Java IDE**.

**2-** Create an instance of the **Game class**.

**3-** Call the **play() method** to start the adventure.
<br><br>

<H2>How to Play</H2>

Explore the rooms to collect DVDs and flash drives.

The correct DVD disables the game centerâ€™s security system, 
and the correct flash drive activates the game center.

Only one item can be carried at a time, so plan your moves carefully.

To win, find and use the correct DVD first,
then the correct flash drive to start the game center. 

Every game is a new challenge, as the correct items are randomly assigned each playthrough.

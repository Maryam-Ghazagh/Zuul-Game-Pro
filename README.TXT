Zuul Game Pro


About This Project

This project is based on the World of Zuul framework from the book Objects First with Java.
The original framework provided a simple text-based adventure game with a few rooms 
and the ability for the player to walk between them.

As part of my Advanced Programming course final project(Spring 2022), I extended and
customized the game to create Zuul Game Pro.


Compared to the original version, Zuul Game Pro includes:

ðŸ”¹ More rooms and a larger world to explore

ðŸ”¹ Additional commands (back, list, look, drop, take)

ðŸ”¹ Interactive objects and items in rooms

ðŸ”¹ Improved command parser

ðŸ”¹ Basic game progression elements


How to Run

1- Open the project in BlueJ or any Java IDE.

2- Create an instance of the Game class.

3- Call the play() method to start the adventure.


How to Play

Explore the rooms to collect DVDs and flash drives.

The correct DVD disables the game centerâ€™s security system, 
and the correct flash drive activates the game center.

Only one item can be carried at a time, so plan your moves carefully.

To win, find and use the correct DVD first,
then the correct flash drive to start the game center. 

Every game is a new challenge, as the correct items are randomly assigned each playthrough.
